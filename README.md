# pst2pdf

Sometimes we want to backup outlook emails in a more convenient way instead of generating a pst file. What if the next platform doesn't support outlook ? What if I just want to see and preserve those important emails quickly ? pst way cannot give me that advantage. I hope to see them in pdf actaully. So let's programm it.

# Features

- multiple pst files to be processed parallelly
- redirect some email info to log file
- support Chinese font output

# Roadmap

- customize ordered output
- make row spacing smaller in output file
